# Release Notes 0.3.0

## 🔍 Detailed Activity Review

We've enhanced the `advocu interactive` experience!

### 📝 Comprehensive Summary
When reviewing your draft before submission, the CLI now displays **all** the specific details you entered for your activity type.

- **Content Creation**: See your Content Type and Reader count.
- **Public Speaking**: Verify Country, City, Event Format, and Attendee count.
- **And more**: Improvements for Workshop, Mentoring, Product Feedback, Interaction, and Stories.

### 🛠️ Fixes

This ensures you can double-check everything is perfect before hitting that submit button.
